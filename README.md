Linear regressions were run for BSE Stock Index upon Money Supply factors M1 and M2. Since values of M1 and M2 have perfect correlation with each other, we use each variable in a separate regression to test significance while avoiding multicollinearity. The code used, along with the data is attached to the repository while the results of the regression are added to the readme file

The linear regressions were done for both variables separately
